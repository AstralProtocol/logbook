# ðŸ§­ Astral Logbook

The Astral Logbook is a decentralized application built on Astral's Location Proof Protocol. 

With the Logbook, users can:
- record geotagged entries
- store log entries onchain
- include a text memo in their entries
- attach content to an entry
- explore an interactive map of entries posted around the world (soon!)
- verify friends' entries (soon!)
- share to decentralized social media (soon!)

The Logbook was built using Scaffold-ETH 2 â€” huge thanks to the BuidlGuidl for this resource!
